# **NOF5MANIFESTO**  
**Never Press F5 Until Itâ€™s Finished**  

We, steadfast and uncompromising software developers, value:  

1. **Writing exhaustive tests** OVER **guessing problems by pressing F5.**  
2. **Addressing every error with intentional debugging and rationality** OVER **relying on luck and instant experimentation.**  
3. **Building code that stands on its own** OVER **constantly running it to validate its correctness.**  
4. **Perfecting thought before code** OVER **blindly trusting execution as a development tool.**  

### **Epilogue**  
Only when your confidence in your work is solid, the code well-written, and the tests unassailable, may you press F5. Not a moment sooner.
